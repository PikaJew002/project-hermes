Hermes: Messenger to the Fam

## WTH is this?
Well, I'll tell you: my family (like many) shares a phone plan. Sometimes it's hard to keep track of who's paid and who hasn't.
Enter Project Hermes.
At its core, Project Hermes is
 - A simple notification system that emails the fam every month a few days before the phone bill is due.
 - In the email is a button/link to mark your share as paid.
 - It gives mom/dad a slick dashboard to see who's paid and who hasn't.
 - And of course it had to be Greek god themed. Because Andrew said it was cool these days.

## Okay, but why...
I really needed an exciting/fun project to test my skills in using Laravel's Scheduler and Mail features. Also, I'd like some feedback from real people actually using my code. What better way than forcing your family to help you.
